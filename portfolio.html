        <br>
        <p>I'm Alex Caraway. I'm a student at the University of Advancing Technology currently. Video games are a huge portion of my life, so it's only natural I'm majoring in Game Programming.</p>

        <p>Worked at McDonalds 2017-2022 as a Crew Member, where I took orders both inside and drive-thru, handled money, made coffee drinks,  and handed food out in the drive-thru. The best description for my work here is 'responding to the needs of both the customer and my managers in a timely manner'.</p>
